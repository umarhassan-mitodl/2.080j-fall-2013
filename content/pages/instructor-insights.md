## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _2.080J Structural Mechanics_ as it was taught by Prof. Tomasz Wierzbicki in Fall 2013.

This course teaches students fundamental concepts of structural mechanics with applications to marine, civil, and mechanical structures.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Use the one-dimensional and two-dimensional structural idealizations of beams, columns, columns, rods, and shell beams to determine stress and deformation states
- Apply such structural idealizations to model general structural configurations under specified loading in order to determine the stress and deformation states
- Assess the applicability of such structural idealizations and judge the errors introduced in their use
